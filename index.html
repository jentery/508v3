<p><em>What we call a videogame is not a product. It's the creation of an author and her accomplice, the player; it is handmade by the former and personally distributed to the latter. The videogame is a zine.</em> -- Anna Anthropy, <a href="http://catalog.sevenstories.com/products/rise-of-the-videogame" target="_blank"><em>Rise of the Videogame Zinesters</em></a></p>

<p>HELLO! This seminar is about literary and cultural approaches to prototyping indie games&mdash;games as gifts, letters, ephemera, hacks, souvenirs, mix tapes, commentaries, jokes, tricks, memoirs, satire, lo-fi art, zines . . . We'll read some history and critical theory, and we'll also experiment with an array of design and development techniques from paper to screen. Early in the term, you'll pick "-isms" (e.g., Futurism, Minimalism, or Surrealism) from the nineteenth or twentieth century that will inform your approach to prototyping throughout the seminar, and by the end you'll create and share your own indie games, complete with their own manuals. In the process, you'll learn a bit about the intersections of new media with art and literature, and we'll demystify the popular assumption that only a "select few" can make games.</p>

    <h3><a id="wk1" class="anchor" href="#wk1">#</a> WEEK 1 (SEPT 7): GAMES + ZINES</h3>
    <p><em>What if some games, and the more general concept of "play," not only provide outlets for entertainment but also function as means for creative expression, as instruments for conceptual thinking, or as tools to help examine or work through social issues?</em> -- Mary Flanagan, <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-play" target="_blank"><em>Critical Play</em></a></p>
    <p>During our first meeting, we'll introduce ourselves, talk about indie games, and work our way through Anthropy's book. We'll also discuss how you can log (or document) your research and prototyping throughout the term. Before we leave, we should start thinking about how groups and collaboration will work, too. </p>

    <h3><a id="wk2" class="anchor" href="#wk2">#</a> WEEK 2 (SEPT 14): -ISMS + SPECULATIONS</h3>
    <p><em>Design your game first, and then add the technology necessary to make it happen.</em> -- Tracy Fullerton, <a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Game-Design-Workshop-A-Playcentric-Approach-to-Creating-Innovative-Games/Fullerton/p/book/9780240809748" target="_blank"><em>Game Design Workshop</em></a></p>
    <p>We'll begin our second meeting with a discussion of the various -isms you researched between last week and this one. After that, we'll talk about speculative design (see Kraus) and games as art (see Pearce). We'll conclude with a low-tech workshop on paper prototyping, which is a way to foreground your ideas and designs without getting caught up the whiz-bang of software, engines, consoles, and the like.</p>

    <p>LOG: Before you begin your log, please form groups (2-4 people). You might also want to start accounts with <a href="https://itch.io/" target="_blank">Itch</a> and <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and install the <a href="https://unity3d.com/webplayer" target="_blank">Unity web player</a>. Your call. Once you are in a group, collectively research at least five -isms active at any point between 1870 and 1970. For each -ism, note the dates of activity, names of participants/contributors, key publications and works of art (including literature, painting, sculpture, film, design, and manifestos), and the aesthetic and political particulars (including how the -ism blended aesthetics with politics). Once you're finished, decide as a group which -ism you'd like to study and reference throughout the term. You might want to consider matters of content, context, <em>and</em> design. What's curious? What will keep you interested? Communicate your decision (your selected -ism) in your log. Together with this research, in your log please also state (in your own words; only a sentence or two) an important argument that Kraus makes. Do the same with Pearce, and alongside these arguments please articulate at least two questions about have in response to these texts. Questions may apply to everything from assumptions made to potential effects on critical or creative practice.</p>

    <h3><a id="wk3" class="anchor" href="#wk3">#</a> WEEK 3 (SEPT 21): HACKS + CHEATS</h3>
    <p><em>As a broader practice, hardware hacking enables a creative form of gameplay that does not necessarily follow the routine interactions intended by game companies. As such, circuit bending sparks a critique of ideology and engages in gameplay at its most operational level, without any false sense of transparency or immediacy.</em> -- Nina Belojevic, <a href="http://www.nanocrit.com/issues/5/circuit-bending-videogame-consoles-form-applied-media-studies" target="_blank">"Circuit Bending Videogame Consoles as a Form of Applied Media Studies"</a></p>
    <p>I'd like to begin this seminar meeting with a discussion of Phillips's work on games and social justice. Then we'll transition into conversations about your gameplay log. The second half of the meeting will focus on modding existing games and bending/changing game templates. We'll look at rather accessible applications such as GameSalad and perhaps Stencyl. I'll also draw from some open source HTML5 games (as an introduction to coding for those of you who are new to it).</p>

    <p>LOG: For this log entry, I'm asking you to perform your first of three gameplay logs. As a group, please select a videogame of your choice. Ideally it's an indie game, but I'm open to whatever you deem best. Please play the game for at least an hour. It may be multiplayer (online or couch), co-op, turn-based, or even single-player (with a group watching and commenting). Please document the play process using video or audio, and then listen to or watch the documentation. In about 250 words (for the group), respond to the documentation using one or two approaches suggested by Consalvo, Dutton, and/or Koster. For instance, you might focus on the unexpected results of play, player suspicion or frustration, when people cheated or tried to cheat, what made players feel good or powerful (and when), what kept people's interests (or didn't), language people used (or invented) during play, or when and why players helped other players. No need to analyze anything, tho. Just document the experience (at least an hour), review it, and write ~250 describing a few aspects of it. You don't need to submit the documentation as part of your log; however, you're welcome to include clips or stills. Alongside this exercise, please also articulate one of Phillips's primary arguments in your own words, together with two specific questions you have about her chapter.</p>
