# What's in a Game? (Tabletop Edition) 

**DRAFT** (without course policies and whatnot) 

Jentery Sayers | English | University of Victoria | Digital Studies Seminar (Fall 2018)

*Get off the internet!* -- Le Tigre (2001)

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 

The University of Victoria's Department of English acknowledges with respect the Lkwungen-speaking peoples on whose traditional territory the university stands and the Songhees, Esquimalt and WSÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

## AIMS 

* Examine the entanglements of game studies with literary studies through A-D-M and M-D-A frameworks that foreground the material dynamics ("D") between aesthetics ("A") and mechanics ("M"); 
* Understand digital studies as a centuries-old design practice and approach it through "low-tech" techniques anchored in gaming; 
* Learn how game prototyping applies (and is arguably foundational) to digital humanities project design and development, with particular attention to paradigms for labour, speculation, access, exchange, and negotiation;
* Prototype an offline tabletop game informed by the politics and aesthetics of an "-ism" (dated between 1870 and 1970) and document the prototyping process; 
* Share and test your tabletop game with people in and beyond this seminar; and 
* Communicate (via a presentation and in writing) the relevance of your game prototype to literary and digital studies. 

## ASSIGNMENTS 

* Design Document (20% x 2): documentation of the iterative design and development of your game, including game components and drafts as well as responses to related readings, games, and playtests  
* Game Prototype (25%): an offline tabletop game complete with a manual, concept doc (with feature list), and "bits" (such as a board, tiles, and cards) enacting the game's theme, mechanics, and system 
* Final Presentation and Paper (20%): a five- to seven-minute talk (delivered at the end of term)revised into a final paper (submitted one or two weeks after the talk)
* Participation (15%): such as preparing for seminar, contributing to discussions, and participating in workshops and playtests 

Please note that I encourage you to avoid prototyping the following types of games (during seminar I'll explain why): trivia, quiz/word, old school revival, tactical war, and mods  

## MATERIALS 

* Access to a computer 
* Access to materials for prototyping (such as graph paper, cardboard, markers, pens, pencils, plasticine, scissors, rulers, cameras, tape, glue, and design and editing software)
* Recommended: [*Tabletop Simulator*](http://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/) and [*Challenges for Game Designers*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/challenges-for-game-designers/oclc/939054849&referer=brief_results), by Romero and Schreiber
* Encouraged: $10-20 to play games at a local board game cafe
