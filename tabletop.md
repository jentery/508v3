## EPIGRAPHS

*Get off the internet!* -- Le Tigre (2001)

*Games are expanding so much in terms of subject matter, in terms of what they're about and who they are able to be about, but let's also expand how they play, what they value, what they expect from the player, what they give back.* -- Anna Anthropy, "Passing Notes"

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 

The University of Victoria's Department of English acknowledges with respect the Lkwungen-speaking peoples on whose traditional territory the university stands and the Songhees, Esquimalt and WSÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

Thanks to Ed Chang, Mary Flanagan, Justin Foran, Garnet Hertz, Patrick Jagoda, Carly Kocurek, Kari Kraus, Anastasia Salter, and Gillian Smith for pointing me to teaching and research materials that inform this seminar.   

## AIMS 

* Examine the entanglements of game studies with literary studies through A-D-M and M-D-A frameworks that foreground the material dynamics ("D") between aesthetics ("A") and mechanics ("M"); 
* Understand digital studies as a centuries-old design practice and approach it through "low-tech" techniques anchored in gaming; 
* Learn how speculative design and game prototyping apply (and are arguably foundational) to digital humanities project design and development, with particular attention to paradigms for labour, speculation, access, exchange, and negotiation;
* Prototype an offline tabletop game informed by the politics and aesthetics of an "-ism" (dated between 1870 and 1970) and document the prototyping process; 
* Share and test your tabletop game with people in and beyond this seminar; and 
* Communicate (via a presentation and in writing) the relevance of your game prototype to literary and digital studies. 

## ASSIGNMENTS 

* **Design Document** (20% x 2): documentation of the iterative design and development of your game, including game components and drafts as well as responses to related readings, games, and playtests  
* **Prototype** (25%): an offline tabletop game complete with a manual, concept doc (with feature list), and "bits" (such as a board, tiles, and cards) enacting the game's theme, mechanics, and system 
* **Talk + Paper** (20%): a five- to seven-minute talk (delivered at the end of term)revised into a final paper (submitted one or two weeks after the talk)
* **Participation** (15%): such as preparing for seminar, contributing to discussions, and participating in workshops and playtests 

Please note that I encourage you to avoid prototyping the following types of games (during seminar I'll explain why): trivia, quiz/word, old school revival, tactical war, and mods. 

## MATERIALS 

* Access to a computer (all assigned readings will be circulated in PDF via a passcode-protected reader)
* Access to materials for prototyping (such as graph paper, cardboard, markers, pens, pencils, plasticine, scissors, rulers, cameras, tape, glue, and design and editing software)
* Recommended: [*Tabletop Simulator*](http://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/), by Berserk Games; and [*Challenges for Game Designers*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/challenges-for-game-designers/oclc/939054849&referer=brief_results), by Romero and Schreiber
* Encouraged: $10-20 to play games at a local board game cafe, and another $10-30 for games available via [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/)   

## Week 1: DISCUSS FRAMEWORKS.  

Prior to seminar, please: 
* Read Kari Kraus, "Finding Faultlines: An Approach to Speculative Design."
* Review the website for the course. 

During seminar, we will: 
* Introduce ourselves, share motivations for the course, and talk about the assignments, with an emphasis on the design document (1 hour).  
* Review keywords and debates related to game prototyping (including the A-D-M and M-D-A frameworks) and then discuss Kraus, "subjunctive knowledge," and "speculative design" (1 hour).
* Paper-prototype a "game state" for a game about . . . ack! . . . grad school (1 hour). Please log and save this work in your design doc.  

## Week 2: SELECT AN -ISM AND PRIMARY TEXT. 

Prior to seminar, please: 
* Read Mary Ann Caws, "The Poetics of the Manifesto: Nowness and Newness."
* Survey some -isms between 1870 and 1970 (e.g., symbolism, absurdism, feminism, futurism) and select one to study this term.
* Pick a primary text (fiction or poetry) that represents the -ism (you will use this text to inform your game prototyping this term).
* Describe (~250 words) your -ism and primary text in your design doc, including bibliographic metadata and considerations of your -ism's history, politics, and aesthetics. 

During seminar, we will: 
* Share your selected -isms and primary texts (1 hour). 
* Discuss your -isms as forms of "action writing" (see Steven Marcus), from aesthetics to mechanics (1 hour). 
* Scenario-prototype possible  "contexts of use" (see Andrea Botero) for your -isms in the present moment (1 hour). Please log and save this work in your design doc. 

## Week 3: Play Some Games. 

Prior to seminar, please: 
* Read Bethany Nowviskie, ["Ludic Algorithms"](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/12544152.0001.001/--pastplay-teaching-and-learning-history-with-technology?g=dculture;trgt=div2_ch7;view=fulltext;xc=1).
* Play at least two different types of tabletop games with someone else in seminar. (You're welcome to include other people, too.)
* Describe (~300 words total) in your design doc the genres, game states, game views, game spaces, and game dynamics of two tabletop games you played. No need to review or analyze the games. Just describe them. 

During seminar, we will: 

* Share your experiences playing tabletop games (30 minutes). 
* Discuss Nowviskie, "ludic algorithms," and procedural experimentation (30 minutes). 
* Paper-prototype your -isms as grid-based tabletop games (1 hour). Please log and save this work in your design doc. 
* Outline issues involved in prototyping your -isms as games via an A-D-M framework (1 hour). Please log and save this work in your design doc.  

## Week 4: Remediate a Videogame. 

Prior to seminar, please: 
* Read Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann, "Deformance and Interpretation."
* Select and play an indie videogame that you will remediate into a tabletop game. 
* Describe (~250 words) in your design doc the setup mechanics, completion conditions, progression type, verbs (or actions), view(s), and player expectations of the videogame you played. Include screengrabs, GIFs, or video where possible. 

During seminar, we will: 

* Discuss Samuels and McGann, "deformance," and "remediation" (see Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin) (30 minutes).
* Paper-prototype tabletop versions of your videogames. You will choose between thematic- and mechanic-based remediations (2.5 hours).
