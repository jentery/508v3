## EPIGRAPHS

*Get off the internet!* -- Le Tigre (2001)

*Games are expanding so much in terms of subject matter, in terms of what they're about and who they are able to be about, but let's also expand how they play, what they value, what they expect from the player, what they give back.* -- Anna Anthropy, "Passing Notes" (2015) 

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 

The University of Victoria's Department of English acknowledges with respect the Lkwungen-speaking peoples on whose traditional territory the university stands and the Songhees, Esquimalt and WSÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

Thanks to Herbert Blau, Kevin Brock, Ed Chang, Mary Flanagan, Justin Foran, Garnet Hertz, Patrick Jagoda, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Carly Kocurek, Kari Kraus, Tara McPherson, Lisa Nakamura, Anastasia Salter, and Gillian Smith for pointing me to teaching and research materials that inform this seminar.   

## AIMS 

* Examine the entanglements of game studies with literary studies through A-D-M and M-D-A frameworks that foreground the material dynamics ("D") between aesthetics ("A") and mechanics ("M"); 
* Understand digital studies as a centuries-old design practice and approach it through "low-tech" techniques anchored in gaming, prototyping, and playtesting; 
* Learn how speculative design and game prototyping apply (and are arguably foundational) to digital humanities project design and development, with particular attention to paradigms for labour, speculation, access, exchange, and negotiation;
* Prototype an offline tabletop game informed by the politics and aesthetics of an "-ism" (dated between 1870 and 1970) and document the prototyping process; 
* Share and test your tabletop game with people in and beyond this seminar; and 
* Communicate (via a presentation and in writing) the relevance of your game prototype to literary and digital studies. 

## ASSIGNMENTS 

* **Design Document** (20% x 2): documentation of the iterative design and development of your game, including game components and drafts as well as responses to related readings, games, and playtests  
* **Prototype** (25%): an offline tabletop game complete with a manual and components (such as a board, tiles, and cards) enacting the game's world (including theme), system (including rules), and dynamics (including interface and relations)
* **Talk + Paper** (20%): a five- to seven-minute talk (delivered at the end of term) revised into a final paper (submitted one or two weeks after the talk)
* **Participation** (15%): such as preparing for seminar, bringing prototypes to meetings, contributing to discussions, and participating in workshops and playtests 

Please note that I encourage you to avoid prototyping the following types of games (during seminar I'll explain why): trivia, quiz/word, old school revival, roll-and-move, tactical war, sequels, expansions, educational, and mods. 

## MATERIALS 

* Access to a computer (all assigned readings will be circulated in PDF via a passcode-protected reader)
* Access to materials for prototyping (such as graph paper, cardboard, cutting mats, rotary cutters, rulers, printers, markers, pens, pencils, plasticine, scissors, rulers, cameras, tape, glue, dice, tokens, and design and editing software)
* Recommended: [*Tabletop Simulator*](http://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/), by Berserk Games; and [*Challenges for Game Designers*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/challenges-for-game-designers/oclc/939054849&referer=brief_results), by Romero and Schreiber
* Encouraged: $10-20 to play games at a local board game cafe, and another $10-30 for games available via [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) 

Please note that we *may* be able to use facilities on campus to fabricate components for your prototypes. These facilities contain 3D printers, routers, and laser-cutters, but some of the equipment may only be used with permission, or is subject to restricted use. Details coming soon.  

## SCHEDULE 

Here's the weekly schedule. Please note that I always over-plan. I will inevitably cut material, including workshops, readings, and/or exercises. Please also note we will be joined by several guest speakers, who do not (yet) appear on this schedule.  

## Week 1: DISCUSS FRAMEWORKS.  

Prior to seminar, please: 
* Read Kari Kraus, "Finding Faultlines: An Approach to Speculative Design."
* Review the website for the course. 

During seminar, we will: 
* Introduce ourselves, share motivations for the course, and talk about the assignments, with an emphasis on the design document (~1 hour).  
* Review keywords and debates related to game prototyping (including the A-D-M and M-D-A frameworks) and then discuss Kraus, "subjunctive knowledge,"  "speculative design," and "design as inquiry" (see Daniela Rosner) (~1 hour).
* Paper-prototype a "game state" for a game about . . . ack! . . . grad school (~1 hour). Please log and save this work in your design doc. 
* Submit exit cards.  

## Week 2: SELECT AN -ISM AND PRIMARY TEXT.

* Survey some -isms between 1870 and 1970 (e.g., symbolism, absurdism, feminism, futurism) and select one to study this term.
* Pick a primary text (fiction or poetry) that represents the -ism (you will use this text to inform your game prototyping this term).
* Describe (~250 words, plus figures) your -ism and primary text in your design doc, including bibliographic metadata and considerations of your -ism's history, politics, and aesthetics. Be as specific and exact as possible yet avoid rehearsing information already found in encyclopedias and other such reference materials.  

During seminar, we will: 
* Share your selected -isms and primary texts (~1 hour). 
* Discuss your -isms as forms of "action writing" (see Steven Marcus), from aesthetics to mechanics (~1 hour).

* Prototype the goals, rules, and mechanics of your game, or how actions will unfold in your world. Experiment with different rules. See which ones are easiest to memorize and rehearse. Consider play to be a form of labour and how process becomes work that is exchanged or negotiated. Please bring the rules to seminar. (It may be easiest to print them.)  
* Describe (~250 words, plus photographs, video, or the like) your game's system. Speak to the negotiations, exchanges, frustrations, and/or narratives it affords. In addition to this description, provide a working draft of your rules. Where possible and relevant, note how your concept doc changed during the prototyping process.      

During seminar, we will:

* Scenario-prototype and playtest dynamics and interfaces for your game. Experiment with balances and settings, such as difficulty and the number of players, and also document people's embodied interactions and responses to playing your prototype. Determine what sort of graphics or other interface components your game needs. You should bring the results (or documentation) to seminar.  
* Describe (~250 words, plus photographs and the like) the dynamics and interface(s) of your game. Speak to the social, affective, and economic relations it affords. Where possible and relevant, note how your concept doc changed during the prototyping process.

* Determine which components of your prototype you want to (re)produce manually and automatically.  

During seminar, we will: 
* Conduct workshops on 3D digitization, modelling, and fabrication, including printing, papercutting, lasercutting, and routing (~2.5 hours). Please log and save this work in your design doc. 
* Discuss the importance of self-care (see Sara Ahmed). 

## Week 11: TAKE A BREAK. 

Step away from it all. 

## Week 12: MAKE YOUR TEXT A MANUAL.

Prior to seminar, please: 

* Draft and print five copies of a manual for your game. It should include a description of your game and the setup, conditions, and components. It should also include and describe all of the rules. Consider including images, such as diagrams, alongside the text. Finally, make sure the manual is available in PDF and tactile form. While the manual need not explain its relationship to your -ism and primary text (that is, the relationship can be implicit), you should come to seminar prepared to discuss that relationship. 
* Refine your prototype where necessary and log the changes in your design doc.

During seminar, we will: 

* Finalize the details for the end-of-term event, including the location, approach/style, content, and communications (~30 minutes). 
* Workshop your manual along with your prototype's world, system, components, and dynamics (~1.5 hours). Please log and save this work in your design doc.

## Week 13: REFINE, PACKAGE, AND ARCHIVE THE PARTS. 

Prior to seminar, please: 

* Polish your prototype in tactile and digital form.
* Gather all the parts in digital form and place them in a single folder, which will become a repository.  

During seminar, we will: 

* Workshop your prototype one more time, with an emphasis on lingering issues and concerns (~30 minutes). 
* Structure digital versions of your prototype as a repository of files and then review techniques for circulating them online (via GitHub and Itch, e.g.). We will also discuss how access relates to these techniques. (~1 hour). 
* Rapid-prototype packages or containers for your game and its parts (~1 hour). 
* Complete course experience surveys (~30 minutes).

Your design document is due this week, too.  

## Weeks 14 and 15: SHARE AND SUBMIT YOUR PROTOTYPE. 

During the end-of-term event, you will: 
* Present your prototype and its relation to your -ism and primary text (5-7 minutes). 
* Invite people to play the prototype of your game, which should be packaged in some way and accompanied by your manual.  
* Document (with written permission) how people play and respond to your prototype.  

After the event, you will:  
* Submit your prototype in tactile and digital form (as a thing and repository of files). The prototype should include your manual and all game components. The tactile version should be packaged.  
* Submit your talk in polished form, as a paper (1500-2000 words, plus figures, notes, and references).
