    <h3>Some quuestions to ask while studying, designing, and developing digital humanities projects</h3>  

<p><strong>AIM</strong>: <em>What is the primary aim of the project?</em> To preserve? Disseminate? Communicate? Analyze? Repurpose? Conjecture? Examine how, where, and through what the arguments are (to be) made. As an essay? In the margins? Via graphs? Via metadata? Quantitatively? Qualitatively? Multimodal? At the micro-, meso-, or macro-level? Who and what are represented, and through which media and techniques? Is the project trying to share things? Document things? Trace things? Map things? Standardize things? Prove things? Theorize things? Imagine things?</p>

<p><strong>REPRESENTATION</strong>: <em>Who is involved in the project's production?</em> Determine who contributed to the project and how their contributions are attributed. Which perspectives are necessary for the research questions at hand? Are those perspectives represented? Who did which kind of work? Who is speaking for or about whom? If students, early-career scholars, or non-academics contributed, were they given credit? Which disciplines are represented? Which forms of expertise, perspectives, and experiences are missing, and which forms are privileged? Which individuals and institutions stand to benefit most from the project? See how/whether the project was funded and by whom. Check the acknowledgments to see who, what, and which territories are included.</p>>

<p><strong>AUDIENCE</strong>: <em>For whom is the project intended? Under what assumptions?</em> Review the project for how it addresses its audience, what it assumes about them, what it includes and excludes, and which norms or biases it replicates. Also consider the style and language(s) used. Determine how it was published (via a journal, press, lab, centre, or university) and through which forms of review.</p>

<p><strong>COMPOSITION</strong>: <em>What are the core components and formats?</em> Consider everything from media (video, image, audio, text, screens, paper), software, hardware, and platforms to TXT, XML, HTML, JS, MP3, MP4, PY, PDF, DOCX, MD, CSV, GIF, CSS, JSON, and JPG, e.g. Can you access the components as individual files? Wherever possible, examine them both separately and together. If you can't access them, then ask yourself why that is. Also consider whether the formats used are open (i.e., not proprietary) and human readable, and also how the project borrows from existing scripts, libraries, and projects. Does it rely on templates? What else does it resemble? Projects are (almost) never built from scratch.</p>

<p><strong>STORAGE</strong>: <em>Where is the project stored?</em> In a library? At a university? With a press? With a specific community? In someone's office? With Amazon, Google, or GitHub? Can you find it in multiple places? If so, then what changes across those locations? When is redundancy an archiving strategy? Or why might a project be found only in one place? In terms of project components, how large are the files? What is used to open them? What are the platform dependencies? To what degree is the data compressed? When is compression strategic?</p>

<p><strong>MAINTENANCE</strong>: <em>Who appears to maintain the project? What seems to be the ten-year plan?</em> Often, the people who imagine, design, or develop a project are not the people who maintain it. Determine how the project is maintained and by whom. Also review it to see whether it has something like a ten-year plan. Where will it be in ten years? Who will keep it running? Update it? Moderate it? When and why does it value ephemerality? Many digital projects may be purposefully or strategically ephemeral.</p> 

<p><strong>PROVENANCE</strong>: <em>How does the project communicate the chronology of its materials?</em> Digital projects frequently rely on (digitized) historical materials, including codices, paintings, sculpture, designs, text, audio, video, blueprints, photographs, notebooks, playbooks, maps, census data, and code, for instance. In the project's presentation of these materials, is their chronology, creation, stewardship, and ownership clear? Can you follow a trail (e.g., back to original collection)? To what does the project point? Where are originals or earlier versions housed? How are they licensed? How have they changed or morphed over time? Are the terms of permission clear? Are metadata and captions available?</p>  

<p><strong>DESIGN</strong>: <em>How is the project designed? What does it afford?</em> All digital projects are designed in some way. Their interfaces may inhibit and invite particular types of input, output, and interactions. These issues are simultaneously political and aesthetic. Of a project, ask how it politicizes aesthetics, or how it aestheticizes politics. Which design choices appear to be deliberate? Which are part of a form or template? Would you call the design minimalist? Maximalist? Does it seem as if it was the last step in the project? Or was design apparently integrated from the beginning? How does input become output? What can you see? What's invisible? What kinds of experiences and traversals are encouraged? When do you want to bounce? What does the project assume about people's abilities and embodied behaviours? Which histories or legacies does it evoke (consciously or not)? Which typeface(s) does it use? Can it be searched? What is controlled by a machine? What is WYSIWYGed? What is done in the command line? What is considered to be "raw"? Is the design responsive (e.g., adjusts to its device, from desktop to phone)? Does it include ads? A key thing to remember is that design is much more than "polish."</p>     

<p><strong>ACCESSIBILITY</strong>: <em>Who can access the project, and how?</em> Among academics, questions of access are frequently grounded in "open access," or freeing research and publications from restrictions such as access tolls or subscriptions. However, access is also about accessibility. Is the project accessible by disabled peopled? For instance, can you easily navigate it with a screen reader or without a mouse? Is alternative text provided for images and other media? Does it pass W3C accessibility standards? Additionally, we might think of access in social, political, cultural, and economic terms. How is the project found? Using which mechanisms? How is the research communicated? What types of expertise are performed through language and word choice? Is the project intended only for particular people? What are the protocols for access, editing, and moderation? Protocols are cultural, and thus there are many compelling reasons to create levels of access for particular projects.</p> 

<p><strong>PROCESSING</strong>: <em>How is the project's content processed? By whom or what?</em> Digital projects combine interpretation by people with interpretation by machines. Some may strike people as very "computational" or "technical." How does input become output? How much does (or will) the project trust the tools and algorithms it uses? How much faith in the machine is required? What is automated? How much should people (including researchers, designers, developers, and audiences) know about the technical bits? If the project converts or remediates historical materials, how are they scanned, describe, and reconstructed by computers? For instance, when do <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/may/01/scanner-ebook-arms-anus-optical-character-recognition" target="_blank">"arms" become "anus"</a>? Are the pre-processed and processed materials provided alongside their interpretation and analysis? These questions underscore how decisions are made and through what sort of negotiations with materials, including but not limited to computers.</p>      

<p><strong>VALUES</strong>: <em>How is technology described and valued?</em> Digital projects are shaped by the values of technocutlure. Does the project locate change in technology? Or is technology an effect or product of social and cultural conditions? Perhaps technology and culture are entwined? How does the project use words such as "new" or "critical"? What produces novelty or critical perspectives, how are they situated, and why are they important? How does the project speak to technology's relation to power, privilege, control, vulnerability, desire, labour, war, governmentality, oppression, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, ability, class, or colonialism? Is technology an instrument? An automated technique? A negotiation? A social construction? An agent? A system of subjectification? An archive? An infrastructure? A specific mechanism? What, if anything, does it determine? To what degree do technical practice and critical theories of technology matter from the project? Which values does the project foreground or invest in? Which are ignored? Which strike you as additive or secondary? For what is the project responsible and accountable? Does it need the words "digital humanities" to be meaningful?</p>  

<p><strong>PARTICULARS</strong>: <em>Where is the project precise? Which details matter most?</em> Projects invest variously in detail. Perhaps dates, locations, or names matter most. Or maybe code or design is the focus. Whatever the particulars, determine why that precision matters for the project and also recognize why it can't be precise about all the things. Scope creep is real in project design, and it is really easy to take on too much.</p>
